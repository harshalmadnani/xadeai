# Project Refactoring

## Changes Made

1. **Reorganized Directory Structure**
   - Created a proper component-based architecture
   - Moved components into logical categories:
     - `/components/agent` - Agent-related components (AgentLauncher, editagent)
     - `/components/agentboard` - Agent board component
     - `/components/auth` - Authentication components
     - `/components/chat` - Chat interface components
     - `/components/terminal` - Terminal component
     - `/components/common` - Shared components

2. **Asset Management**
   - Moved assets to their appropriate directories:
     - `/assets/images` - Image files
     - `/assets/fonts` - Font files and CSS

3. **Utility Functions**
   - Separated utility functions into `/utils` directory
   - Moved API-related code to utils
   - Created `/utils/data` for data files like coins.js

4. **Testing**
   - Moved test files to `/tests` directory

5. **Data Files**
   - Organized JSON/JSONL files in `/assets/data`

6. **Fixed Import Issues**
   - Updated import paths across components
   - Fixed font paths in CSS files

## Removed Files
- Duplicate `.gitignore` file
- Unused test files

## Benefits
- Improved code organization
- Better component separation
